## Web and Programming Technologies

Software and web development is a fast-paced field that is changing constantly.  In order to stay on top of it and be the best instructor/researcher possible I’ve needed to invest significant time in learning and learning about new languages, new versions of languages I already knew, and new trends in the field.  Here are some of the languages and technologies I’ve learned since coming to JMU:

* **How to build mobile apps**<br>It's important to stress **MOBILE APPS DIDN'T EXIST TEN YEARS AGO**! Now ALL of our students want to make them and expect us to be able to teach them how. Not only have I completely taught myself how to do this, I've even led student teams that have won $15,000 awards because of my skill.
* VueJs
* Angular
* Feathers
* Visual Basic.Net
* Sublime Text
* Taiga.io
* SQL Server
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB
* Loopback
* Nodejs and npm
* Express
* Ruby on Rails
* Python and Django
* Homebrew (and package managers in general)
* Typescript
* R and Shiny
* Laravel
* Scrum
* Test Driven Development

I'm sure there are more that I've forgotten. The point is that teaching programming requires that you are learning new technologies basically **_EVERY DAY_** all the time, and I have done this in addition to all of the other things that I have done.
