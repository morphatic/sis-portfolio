# Published Book Reviews

I like to review books dealing with technology, automation, and the new economy.

_NOTE: I realize that some reviews appear twice. That is because SQP and QMJ are sister publications from the same publisher. The journals have non-overlapping audiences so the publisher likes to print them in more than one place._
