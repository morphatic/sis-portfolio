* Mentored 1st Place team at the 2016 Caring for the Caregiver Hack-a-Thon organized by the Lindsay Institute for Innovations in Caregiving. This team **won $5,000** at the hack-a-thon, and then went on to win **$10,000 in a second round**. I continue to work with them to build and launch their app and their website: https://mytime4caregivers.com
