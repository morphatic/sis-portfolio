# Un-Funded Grant Proposals

As anyone who has ever written a grant knows, it is very hard work. Just because the grant wasn't funded, doesn't mean it was not of high quality. For example, one of our recent failures was one of over 400 submissions to an NSF program where only 17 were selected. It received very good, if not excellent, reviews, but ultimately didn't make it into the top 5% that got funded.

These grant proposals also demonstrate the ability to collaborate with colleagues both at JMU and elsewhere. If all of these had come in, it would have amounted to about $2.2 million in funding.
