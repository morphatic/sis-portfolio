# The Story of my Service

I have been a consistent and energetic participant in service that serves students, ISAT, JMU, my profession, and my community.  Wherever possible, I have sought to use my particular strengths and talents in my service, i.e.

* my deep understanding of technology, and
* my understanding of learning, motivation, and pedagogy.  

I believe I have pursued opportunities to use my expertise effectively within the ISAT Department, at the University level, and increasingly in national and international contexts. I will summarize my activities and accomplishments here.

My knowledge of technology has been of use in the following types of service:

* Helping JMU and ISAT make technology adoption decisions. I have been a contributing member to the committees that:
    * Selected Canvas as the replacement for Blackboard
    * Selected Blue Response as the university-wide online course-evaluation delivery system
    * Asked to serve on the committee to select the replacement for Qualtrics (starting 2018-19 academic year)
* I also have been a catalyst to get JMU to acquire access to more advanced computing infrastructure such as:
    * The programmable Qualtrics API, which I have used in software development both in my teaching and for funded research
    * Joining the Apple Developer program so that our students can build and test mobile applications for the iOS platform. This would otherwise cost each student $99/year.
    * Moving our courses steadily toward using free, open-source software instead of expensive, proprietary systems
    
I sit on the CISE IT Advisory Committee, and have been the liaison between the IKM Academic Team and TSEC/LabOps/CISE-IT. I was asked to lead a team of HHS students to a hack-a-thon in Richmond, VA, which the students won ($5000 first round, $10,000 second round). I have judged the Bluestone Hacks competition in the JMU XLabs, and I was sought after for advising [the Fueled Project](//teaching/fueled.md) on how web and IoT technology could be made a part of their platform.

My knowledge of course evaluation, pedagogy, and motivation has become of value in the following types of service:

* Chairing the JMU Faculty Senate's Academic Policies Committee (2013-2018)
* Considering new options for the JMU Academic Calendar
* Gathering, analyzing and summarizing the entire JMU faculty opinions on issues such as:
    * Observance of Labor Day
    * Instituting a formal "Reading Day" prior to or during Fall and Spring exams
    * Creating a winter-term
* I have also sat on University-wide committees and task forces to:
    * Examine JMU's concept and culture of academic rigor
    * Guide the administration on the best way to roll-out and implement online course evaluations

At the department level, I have served on the Assessment Committee for ten years, and now chair it. I have contributed to our ABET process, the development of the PCHOM Spine Rubric, the Foundations Review and Redesign Committees, and now the Student Evaluations of Teaching (SET) Task Force.

In addition to the use of my intellectual and professional gifts, I am a regular financial contributor to scholarships in the ISAT Department--the Maury Wolla Scholarship, and the Richard Roberds Scholarship--to which I make an automatic contribution every pay period.

In addition to my discipline-specific service, I am a frequent and regular participant and contributor to faculty meetings and summits, and I have generally been willing to serve in most any capacity that I was asked. I believe I have a reputation for being a contributor of thoughtful ideas, particularly when thinking about long-term implications and impacts. I consider myself an aggressive advocate for students. I am known for being a good note-taker.

My service contribution has been considered **_excellent_** in the majority of my annual reviews, and more recently, I believe the length of my tenure chairing university-level committees like APC merits an evaluation of **_excellent_** when applied to the full scope of my service.
