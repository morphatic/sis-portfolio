# Evidence of Service

As with the the previous sections, if the [Service Narrative](service_narrative.md) describes the overview, the Evidence of Service section describes the detail. Please find below a catalogue of the ways in which I have endeavored to be useful to the variety of communities of which I am a member.

1. Service that advances the mission of James Madison University, the College of Integrated Science and Engineering, and the Department of Integrated Science and Technology:
    1. Serving as a valued member on:
        * [Departmental Committees](/service/department.md)
        * [College Committees](/service/college.md)
        * [University Committees](/service/university.md)
        * [Committees on Course Evaluation](/service/course_evals.md)
    2. Participating in public relations and recruiting
        * Because of my efforts, [ISAT now has a new YouTube channel for our capstone project presentation videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbYPzdPbZjPdJiU2X5L_cFA) that can be used to advertise and recruit
        * Led a cross-disciplinary team of students to victory at the 2016 Annual Caring for the Caregiver Hackathon in Richmond, VA, March 25-27. The team won $5000 in round one, resulting in publication in regional news and on the JMU website
        * Led the same team to win round two, $10,000, resulting in more press coverage. The team has now officially formed an LLC and I’m working with them to commercialize their product.
        * Attended ISAT 20th Anniversary weekend in April 2014
        * I represented JMU and ISAT at the Tech Expo held at Liberty University during the Fall of 2008 and also went on a recruiting trip to the Central Virginia Governor’s School in Lynchburg, VA
        * I have been one of the primary organizers and speakers at the Fall ISAT Recruiting Events held every year through 2012.  These events usually net 8-10 new majors each year.
        * I created and ran the ISAT Video Contest which increased awareness about ISAT such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iDe5Xt6I94)
        * I have participated in most of the Saturday Open Houses, Take-A-Look days and Choices events since I’ve been here.  In particular, I was asked to be a speaker at the Choices event held in the Convo Center in Spring 2008.
    3. Securing funding for teaching and equipment support
        * I have routinely participated in putting together ETF requests for new technology
        * Was able to get $10,000 from the Provost and another $5,000 from 4VA to teach the first Fueled class in the XLabs in spring 2017
        * A number of the [successful funding proposals I've submitted over the years](//scholarship/funding.md) have included money for teaching and equipment support
    4. Advising Student Organizations
        * **ISAT Honor Society (IHS): 2009-2015**<br>I took over IHS from Chris Bachmann, and passed it on to Shannon Conley. During my time, I helped get IHS involved in the Annual ISAT Golf Challenge, formalize the tutoring the IHS does, and also tried to deepen the significance of the investiture ceremony.
        * **Japan Club: 2010-present**<br>This club was formed by a group of students who went on a study abroad with me to Japan. I played a much more active role in the first few years. More recently, I've mainly helped coordinate bringing the JET Program recruiter to campus.
    5. Serving as a satisfactory student curriculum advisor:
        * Most of the curricular advising I do is incidental to the large number of capstones that I mentor.
        * In 2012-13 I stepped in to advise the IKM concentrators while Dr. Tony Teate was on a leave of absence. Since the 4th course of the IKM concentration is flexible, this involved a fair amount of discussing options with students.
    6. Initiating and carrying out a program which leads to a significant increase in ISAT or JMU resources, or in ISAT’s or JMU’s ability to perform its mission:
        * **PI, IDEA Grant, Spring 2011, $4,000**: This grant was won to support bringing Cindy Klevickis’ New Beginnings students from Huguenot High School in Richmond, VA.  This school serves primarily minority and low-income students and our efforts here are likely to help increase minority STEM enrollment as well as the number of ISAT majors, in addition to increasing ISAT and faculty awareness of diversity issues.
        * **Co-PI (PI: Eric Pappas) _A Contextual Approach to Researching and Teaching Sustainability_, NSF EEC Division, 2011, $431,202**: This grant resulted in a number of peer-reviewed papers on teaching sustainability, and also supported some of the development of courseware used in my teaching.
    7. Performing a major service or office at the Department, College or University level:
    8. Providing service leadership, e.g. the ability to initiate and execute constructive change in the ISAT program:
2. Service that advances one's professional scholarly community:
    1. Serving as a referee or reviewer of scholarly articles or textbooks:
        * [Published book reviews](/scholarship/reviews.md)
        * Reviewed the manuscript for: Salib, E. H. et. al. (2013) Designed-for-Motivation based Learning for Large Multidisciplinary Team One Semester Hands-on Network based Course Case Study, ASEE Annual Conference, June 23-26, 2013, Atlanta, GA
        * Reviewer for Journal of Information Systems Education
        * Reviewer for the journal Computers & Education
        * Reviewer for the AMCIS 2008 conference
    2. Serving as an officer of a professional organization:
        * Executive Director, Burning Nerds, Burning Man Project, 2013-present: In this role I help organize the annual un-conference held at Burning Man, and also manage the group's mailing list.
        * Co-Organizer, Black Rock Educators Consortium
        * Regional Coordinator for the American Society for Quality (ASQ) Software Division, 2010-2012, Region 11
    3. A major effort conducting workshops, symposia, and training sessions in ones' professional area:
        * Co-chaired the one-day long Transforming Learning Conference (August 30, 2013 at Black Rock City, NV) w/ N. Radziwill that brought together educators and others interested in stimulating life-long learning. This session was sponsored by TEDxBRC.
        * Co-chaired Black Rock Educators Consortium Annual Meeting, Black Rock City, NV, August 29, 2014
        * Co-chaired Black Rock Educators Consortium Annual Meeting, Black Rock City, NV, August 28, 2015
3. Service that benefits society in ares related to one's professional expertise:
    1. A contribution which applies the resources of the University to solving a problem of local, regional, state, national, or international concern.
        * The Next Step wind energy economic calculator (Best Honors Thesis, ISAT Integration Award 2010) was instrumental in helping the Virginia Wind Energy Collaborative filter calls from property owners in VA wishing to claim federal subsidies for installing small-scale wind power production.
        * Used the Diversity Council's IDEA Grant to bring underrepresented youth to JMU from Richmond's Huguenot High School (see 1.vi. above).
    2. Other professional service directed at the betterment of society in the area of one’s professional competence which the PAC deems to be a significant contribution.
        * I have built websites from time to time for community organizations, such as the Shenandoah Valley Children's Choir
        * Harrisonburg City Schools Gifted Advisory Committee, 2009-2012: I’ve helped move the city schools to modify their definition of “gifted” from one recognizing general ability (i.e. math and English), to one that recognizes giftedness in multiple areas including math, language arts, fine art and dance, athletics, and industrial arts.  The city school’s budget for gifted education has been reorganized accordingly.  I also helped make the move to a School-wide Enrichment model that will benefit more students and recognize talent in a broader cross-section of the student body. I chaired the committee in my last year of service.
