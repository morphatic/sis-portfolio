# Service

Being a responsible member of my community is important to me. This section describes the ways that I have employed my talents and abilities in service to others over the scope of my career, with emphasis on the years since I earned tenure. The narrative is designed to provide an overview and a sense for how all of the puzzle pieces fit together. The evidence is a finer-grained categorization, description, and contextualization of the individual elements that make up the narrative.
