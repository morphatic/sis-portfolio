# Letters of Recommendation

Although I'm not sought after super frequently, I am always ready and willing to serve as a reference or to write a letter of recommendation for students that I have had the opportunity to get to know. I estimate that I write on the order of 2-3 letters per year for current and former students.

My students, in particular my capstone students, have tremendously high rates of employment after graduation. Companies like Deloitte, IBM, Accenture, and other tech firms continue to return to ISAT because they find our students to be very well prepared and having an excellent balance of technical knowledge coupled with an ability to hit the ground running in teams and interacting with clients.
