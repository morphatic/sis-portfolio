# End-of-Semester Interviews

Nearly every semester beginning in the Fall 2011 semester, rather than final exams, I had a **_one-on-one interview with every student_** in every one of my courses during the final exam week. The interviews lasted anywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour (or more in some cases) and I typically spent about 30-40 hours meeting with students during final exam week.

Before they arrived for their interview, students were asked to write a reflective exit essay and bring it with them. Here is the email that I typically sent them:

> Hello Everyone,<br><br>So, it is time to set up our end-of-semester exit interviews. Interviews will take place between 9AM and 5PM on Monday through Thursday of exam week. I will have a signup sheet in class on Friday before exams. Those who show up to class will get first dibs on an interview time slot.<br><br>Your interview will be relaxed and friendly. I would like you to bring a PRINTED copy of your end-of-semester narrative essay. Here are the questions I would like you to address:

> * What were your expectations coming into this class
* What learning goals did you set for yourself?
* How did your goals evolve over the course of the semester? 
* In what ways did you feel you were successful?  Please refer to specific, concrete artifacts that would serve as evidence of your successes. 
* In what areas do you feel you failed to achieve your goals?  
* Please reflect on what you think you've learned from your failures, and what, if any, plans you have to address those issues in the future. 
* JMU's Mission Statement is to produce "educated and enlightened citizens who lead meaningful and productive lives."  Do you feel more educated?  More enlightened?  Less so? 
* How have your activities this semester contributed or detracted from your knowing yourself better and having a better grasp on what you want to do in the near or distant future? 
* How did this style of course work for you?  
If you were to take it again what would you recommend that I do it the same or differently? 
* What grade would you like for me to report to the registrar for you, and why? 

> The goal of this narrative is to give you an opportunity to do some deep reflection.  Take it seriously.  Take a good, long, hard look in the mirror.<br><br>Have fun with it.  I expect that doing a good job of this will probably mean that you'll write somewhere in the 3-5 page range (single spaced).<br><br>Thank you for a great semester, and I hope to see many of you in the future!<br><br>Cheers,<br>Morgan

## What Did I Learn?

In short, a tremendous amount!!! Although they were tiring and time-consuming, the ritual of meeting with everyone face-to-face at the end of the semester became one of my favorite parts of the semester. More specifically:

* Students were extremely open and forthcoming in these interviews; I really had an opportunity to help them process their experiences and put them into a larger, longer-term context.
* Students were remarkably frank about providing me with feedback about how I ran the course--I took notes on the things they like and didn't like and incorporated many of their suggestions into future semesters.
* When students came in nervous, I was almost always able to put them at ease by asking them a more general, but personal, question like, "So, how are your exams going? Almost done?" After a couple of minutes of chit-chat and convincing them that I was not going to grill them, we were able to dive into the important things we had to discuss.
* Students frequently commented that they wished there was time to do this more than once a semester. Students who had taken a class from me in a previous semester commented that they looked forward to their exit interviews.

In summary, I found that this style of "final exam" took about the same amount of time as I would normally spend alone grading papers, but was more enjoyable, and ultimately provided formative feedback for both the students and myself to take into the future.
