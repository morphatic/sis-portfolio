# Morphatic--My Blog

[![](/assets/morphatic_logo_bw.png)](http://morphatic.com)

In late 2015, I resurrected my blog. Since then I've written about 20 posts, and developed regular traffic yielding about 100 visits per day, or 3000 per month. My more popular posts are tutorials like:

* [Super-fast Secure WordPress Install on DigitalOcean with NGINX, PHP7, and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](http://www.morphatic.com/2016/05/21/super-fast-secure-wordpress-install-on-digitalocean-with-nginx-php7-and-ubuntu-16-04-lts/)
* [Creating a Filter Pipe for Angular 2 (in Ionic 2)](http://www.morphatic.com/2016/06/23/creating-a-filter-pipe-for-angular-2-in-ionic-2/)

People also seem to like my series of blog posts on [building a DIY bubble tube](http://www.morphatic.com/2016/04/27/diy-led-bubble-tube-part-6-first-test/). I've used this series to get students excited about building IoT (internet-of-things) projects in JMU's XLabs.

More recently I've been writing a series of posts detailing [how to build a collaborative 900-pixel programmable LED light show](https://morphatic.com/2018/07/26/building-a-collaborative-900-pixel-app-controlled-led-light-show-part-1/). The end goal will be to have a participatory art installation in my office that will invite and encourage students to get involved with both programming and their professor (i.e. me). This work builds off of the [successful work on STEM to STEAM](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/steam/vol2/iss1/3/) that I began with Dr. Radziwill and several of our capstone students.

I like writing the blog because it helps me solidify my understanding of new and cutting edge topics in programming and web development, and also because it allows me to share that with my students and also get some external validation from the world.
