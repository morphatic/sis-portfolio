# Teaching

This section describes my educational philosophy and practice, and the ways that it has evolved over my career, with emphasis on the years since I earned tenure. The narrative is designed to provide an overview and a sense for how all of the puzzle pieces fit together. The evidence is a finer-grained categorization, description, and contextualization of the individual elements that make up the narrative.
