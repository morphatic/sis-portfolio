# Study Abroad

I have participated in several different study abroad programs at JMU. About 25% of JMU students currently study abroad. As part of JMU's Vision to become the "national model of the engaged university," the Center for Global Engagement (formerly the Office of International Programs), has been charged with increasing that to a target of 33% of all students. I have participated in that and it has had a number of far-reaching impacts.

## Japan Study Abroad

In 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2015 I took student groups to Tokyo and other destinations in Japan for a 5-week experience focused on learning the language and culture. I developed one new course for that: **[GHUM 252--Cross-cultural Perspectives in Japan](https://github.com/morphatic/isat-portfolio/raw/master/supporting_materials/syllabi/2012_2/GHUM252JapanSyllabus_Benton_2012May.docx)**. As a result of this:

1. Four of my former students have been able to subsequently live and work in Japan
2. Another student is now doing his Masters in Journalism at Waseda University (#2 University in Japan) and is in the process of starting a [boy-band that will foster international understanding](https://www.guyjin48.com/).
3. I was able to help organize and support the residency at JMU of [internationally recognized Takuya Muramatsu of Dairakudakan](https://www.jmu.edu/forbescenter/events/2014/01/24-takuya-muramatsu-butoh.shtml) in JMU's School of Dance.

## Philippines Study Abroad

In Summer 2015, I was co-director of JMU's 3-week study abroad trip to the Philippines. While on that trip, I met Amanda Presgraves, who had just finished her sophomore year. My subsequent interactions with Amanda helped lead to the creation of [Fueled, the Asian-fusion, locally-sourced, food truck on campus](/teaching/fueled.md).

## Sustainable Environmental Resource Management (SERM) in Malta

I was half of the teaching team for [ISAT 640--Information and Technology Management](https://github.com/morphatic/isat-portfolio/raw/master/supporting_materials/syllabi/2012_1/2012_2_ISAT_640_MALT_01_Syllabus.pdf) for four years (2010-2013). I helped pioneer that course in its online mode, which allowed the program to survive during the "lean years." I also was a member of the thesis committees for several of the SERM students.

## Other Programs

I have also contributed to the planning of Dr. Radziwill's study abroad in Iceland, which was supported but has not run yet.
