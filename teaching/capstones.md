# Capstones and Student Research

I am one of the most active capstone advisors in all of ISAT. In twelve years I have mentored:

* 40 Projects
* 75 Students
* 2 Best Honors Theses
* 1 ISAT Integration Award
* 1 Best IA Thesis Award
* 2 Successful businesses launched from capstone, one of which has received [national press coverage](http://wapo.st/2yJfMYV?tid=ss_mail&utm_term=.162ebd4f9771)
* 1 NCUR publication
* 1 Refereed journal publication
* Over $100,000 in funding

That's an average of over 3 projects and 6 students per year. The ISAT capstone project is my favorite part of the major. Although it consumes a considerable amount of time and energy, I truly enjoy the opportunity to work one-on-one with students and build things that can have a lasting impact.

For example, the work I did over several years with several students on the UMatter2Us project has been incorporated into the [custom courseware](/teaching/courseware.md) that I use to teach all of my classes currently.

I have been an active participant in the evolution of the capstone into a 4-semester sequence since the fall of 2013 when the first experimental version of what we now call ISAT 490 was run. I have visited Dr. Bachmann and Dr. Conley's ISAT 490 classes frequently, and have actively participated in discussions about how to improve the 490-491 sequence.

I was also a member of the committee led by Tom Benzing that examined the ISAT capstone workload balance among faculty during the 2016-17 academic year.
