# Breadth of Teaching Contexts

The SIS Faculty Evaluation Guidelines specify in section II.B.2.e that in order to be deemed _Excellent_ in teaching, a faculty member must demonstrate "quality teaching in a variety of learning contexts." Below is a simple list of the different contexts in which I've taught. Descriptions of and evidence for the quality of the content taught in these contexts is documented in the other sections of this portfolio. 

* Traditional lecture
* Team-taught courses with up to 4 instructors
* Programming lab
* Live, synchronous, online via Skype
* In 2000+ year old rice fields in remote villages only accessible by foot (Batad, Philippines)
* In 1000 year old Buddhist temples (Kyoto, Japan)
* Small discussion/seminar style classes
* Independent/small group study
* Project-based
