# Special Topics Courses

I frequently offer ISAT 480 Special Topics courses. Much of the time, this is because I'm following the students where they lead, which is often close to the cutting edge of my field. Other times, it is because I'm able to see that a new topic is becoming relevant and I know that I need to gain some expertise in it to stay fresh. Here is a selection of courses that I have offered.

## Mobile App Development--with Dr. Emil Salib, ISAT

It's hard to believe given how ubiquitous mobile apps are these days that we haven't always had course content in how to develop them. In the [Fall 2012 semester](https://github.com/morphatic/isat-portfolio/raw/master/supporting_materials/syllabi/2012_3/2012_3_ISAT_480_0005_01_Syllabus.pdf), Dr. Salib and I got together to offer our first attempt at a mobile app development course. We offered this course a second time in the [spring of 2014](https://github.com/morphatic/isat-portfolio/raw/master/supporting_materials/syllabi/2014_1/2014_1_ISAT_480_0005_01_Syllabus.pdf). It was challenging given that the tools, technologies, and languages were literally evolving rapidly from day-to-day while we were teaching the course.

In the time since then, rather than create a standalone course, the mobile app development material has been absorbed and [distributed among ISAT 252, 340, 345, and 348](https://code4your.life) on the software side. On the networking side, Dr. Salib has moved that content into the TNS curriculum.

## Agile Development for Lean Startup--with Dr. Nicole Radziwill, ISAT

In the spring 2015 semester, the Computer Science department informed the IKM team that our students would no longer be allowed to take their CS 345 Software Engineering course which had always been cross-listed with ISAT 345, and was a requirement for the IKM concentration. Knowing that I would have to teach ISAT 345 in Fall 2015, and also having some seniors who needed a 4th IKM concentration course, Dr. Radziwill and I offered a course in [Agile Development for Lean Startup](https://github.com/morphatic/isat-portfolio/raw/master/supporting_materials/syllabi/2015_1/2015_1_ISAT_480_0007_01_Syllabus.pdf). The concepts in this course have evolved into both [the current ISAT 345 curriculum](https://code4your.life/syllabi/isat-345-software-engineering/), but it also resulted in:

* [The IGNITE and HCO3 proposals](/teaching/ignite.md)
* [An IndieGoGo Campaign to fund HCO3](https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/e39cfa10) (never launched)


## The Quantified Self & Chronic Condition Management

I was introduced to the Quantified Self movement by my capstone students Ben Campbell and Eric Walisko during the 2014-15 academic year. By spring 2017, I had acquired several activity monitoring devices--a FitBit, a Spire, and a Misfit--and begun working with students to use their software APIs to begin creating apps to manage chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes.

## The Fueled Project--with Dr. Mark Gabriele, Biology

This [course and projects are described here](/teaching/fueled.md). I am a founding member of the Fueled Steering Committee, and will likely teach the Fueled course again in the future.
